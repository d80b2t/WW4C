# WW4C

The WISE W4 Compendium (WW4C) is a detailed study into the objects
that were detected in the longest waveband, 20-28um observed, on the
Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010, Cutri
et al. 2013) mission.

This study will describe all 40 million objects that are detected in
the WISE W4-band, but will concentrate on those objects most affected
by radiating dust emission and well described by extragalactic, and
AGN, spectral energy distributions (SEDs).  The motivations of theWW4C
are numerous, but the primary science we will pursue is the
identification of bolometric luminous AGN, especially those that might
not be observed in X-ray/UV/optical surveys.

This (GitHub) Repository is an attempt to bring the WW4C to the widest
possible audience.

The data is open and public (available at
http://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/frontpage/).

The analysis will be open and public, and I hereby cede all my (NPRs)
IP on these projects.  How other contributors feel, I'll let them
decide.

The write-up, which, in an ideal world would be submitted to a
prestigious academic journal will also be held here, and if you
contribute, I'd like and expect you to be an author on the resulting
papers.

Please, feel 100% free to contact me here to ask about any and all
further deets.

Tell then, Backwards and With Heels.
