\section{Motivation}
The WISE W4 23$\mu$m band is shallow. Therefore, anything that is detected in
W4, and is {\it not} a Milky Way star, or nearby e.g. dusty spiral
galaxy, is going to be intrinsically very luminous. Furthermore,
objects that are also detected in W4, but are faint/non-detected in
the optical, or in the shorter WISE W1/W2 bands also have very
interesting properties, \citep[e.g.,][]{Assef15, Tsai15, Lonsdale15,
Assef16, Diaz-Santos16, Ricci17, Wu17, Jones17, Farrah17}.  The WISE
W4 band is also crucial in the discovery and characterization of the
``Extremely Red Quasar'' population, using a colour selection of
$r_{\rm AB} âˆ’ W4_{\rm Vega} >14.0$ \citep{Ross15, Zakamska16,
Hamann17}.

Note, the W4 channel effective wavelength was recalibrated from the
original 22$\mu$m by \citet{Brown14b}.


\section{Matching the Gaia DR1 and WISE W4 catalogs}

    \subsection{WISE}
    The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) mission description and
    initial on-orbit performance is described in \citet[][]{Wright10}.
    We use the \href{http://wise2.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/release/allwise/expsup/}
    {\tt AllWISE Data Release}. 

    There are 40,939,966 objects, with $>2\sigma$ detections at WISE
    W4 in the AllWISE Catalog. The W4 PSF is 12'', but the centroid
    positions should be good to $\lesssim2''$ (WISE HelpDesk,
    priv. comm.).  Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} shows the sky distribution of
    these 40.9M objects.  The WISE scanning pattern can clearly be

      seen}}.

    \subsection{Gaia DR1} 
    We use the \href{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dr1}{{\tt Gaia Data Release 1}}.

    The Gaia DR1
    \href{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/documents/29201/1125416/magnitude+histogram+placeholder.png/}
    {magnitude histogram} peaks around 20th magnitude in G-band. The
    G-band is a very wide filter, that covers the wavelength range frthat
    covers the wavelength range from about 350 to 1000nm, with the maximum
    energy transmission at $\sim$715 nm and the full width at half maximum
    of 408 nm.  (Jordi \&. Carrasco, 2007, ASPC, 364, 215).
    
    There are 1,142,679,769 sources in total in the Gaia DR1. 



    \subsection{Matching}
    We match the two catalogues with a matching radius of 2'' and 10''. 
    This is done using some v. nice and quick code from R. Collins [More details required here]. 
    The results are given in Figure~\ref{fig:fig2} and Figure~\ref{fig:fig4}. 
    Figure~\ref{fig:fig3} shows the WISE W4 Unique ID (UID; which isa a proxy for object declination) 
    versus the Gaia DR1 Source ID. 


\section{Results of matching}
The matched 10'' GaiaDR1xWISEW4 catalogue returns 71,593,922 objects
since one-to-many (WISE-to-Gaia) matches are allowed. The Python
\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.unique.html}{{\tt
numpy unique}} command is used to return the sorted unique elements of
this catalogue. 24,671,865 WISE W4 objects have a unique match with a
Gaia source within 10''. 

Thus, 16,268,101 objects in the WISE W4 catalogue do not have a

Figure~\ref{fig:fig4} shows the matching radius separation histograms for objects, 
with and without duplicates.

Figure~\ref{fig:fig5} (top) shows the all-sky distribution for the
full 40.9M objects that are detected in WISE W4 (same as
Figure~\ref{fig:fig1} but with a different
colour-scale). Figure~\ref{fig:fig5} (middle) shows the all-sky distrubtion of 
objects that were matched to a Gaia DR1 source. The overdensity of the Milky 
Way is clearly seen. Figure~\ref{fig:fig5} (bottom) shows the 16.3M objects 
that do {\it not} have a match in the Gaia DR1.
