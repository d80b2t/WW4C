Hi Nic,

Pandas is awesome and I'd recommend it to anyone. In this specific
case I'm not exactly sure how you'd read in but looking up on the
read_table docs it looks alright, but once you have the dataframe you
access the columns by data[column_name] which are (if it has been read
in correctly) the headers.

The way to find out what columns it has read in is just
print data.columns

If it doesn't show up the headers you expect then it probably hasn't
been read in properly and I'd recommend looking at the read_table docs

Hope this helps!

Joey
