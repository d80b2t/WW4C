Hi there GitHub!!

      Username: d80b2t

So, hopefully a fairly basic question/issue, but one I don't know the 'best' solution to. 
I have a new repository called WW4C. 

I'm developing code on my local machine in the directory: 
 ~/programs/WW4C 
and have done my git init etc. to make get things going here: 
~/programs/WW4C/.git 

However, I'm writing up my LaTeX notes for the WW4C in this other local directory:
~/LaTeX/WW4C
and *really* want to keep the two local directories on my machine separate (for e.g. version control and back-up purposes). 

Thus, how do I initialize a 
github.com/d80b2t/WW4C/LaTeX 
directory and push/pull commits there??

Thanks!
Nic
