# SED Templates

# Purpose.
I want this to be a repo dir where I/anothers build up a list and series of SED templates.

Hi Nic, 

Sorry for the slow response - it was ALMA deadline day yesterday and I was PI'ing two and co-I'd 6. Phew!

 Are your 2011 models still basically state-of-the-art??
In terms of mid-IR spectral shape, I don't think I've seen as large a compendium of AGN-dominated IR spectra to date. I think IRS spectra are by far the best way to constrain the detailed shape of the MIR emission of AGN. When they're clearly AGN (i.e., power-law) dominated, they're pretty irrefutable, as opposed to the far-IR which requires more assumptions.
However, that doesn't mean that my 2011 paper can't be bettered, and is something I'd like to explore further. There are now reduced catalogues of IRS spectra (try Cassis: http://cassis.sirtf.com/atlas/ ) which could be a treasure trove of AGN-dominated spectra, if it's possible to mine in an appropriate way.

I'm not aware of any Galactic models of MIR emission. Do you mean observations of individual Galactic sources, or the diffuse MIR emission of the galaxy (I presume the former). Is the idea to use them to remove, e.g., stars, from e.g., WISE data??

Cheers,
