# SED Templates

## Purpose
I want this to be a repo dir where I/anothers build up a list and series of SED templates.

Nonetheless, these intensive efforts have unexpectedly ended in
significant disagreements about the appropriate template, especially
for the far-IR (e.g., from 20 to 1000 μm). This can be seen in Figure
1, where we provide a partial summary of the IR AGN templates in the
literature.::

Examples of proposed empirical AGN SED templates, normal- ized at 3.0
μm. The nine versions are Elvis et al. (1994) based partly on the
Palomar-Green (PG) sample; the same with a far-infrared star-forming
component removed (Elvis noSF) by Xu et al. (2015); Richards et
al. (2006) based on 259 quasars; the radio-quiet quasar template in
Shang et al. (2011); the star-formation-corrected AGN template based
on the radio-quiet PG sam- ple proposed by Symeonidis et al. (2016);
AGN3 from Kirkpatrick et al. (2015) with star formation removed by
subtracting the suitably normalized SFG2 from the same source; Netzer
et al. (2007) with star formation sub- traction in the far-IR; that
proposed by Hanish et al. (2013); and the QSO1 template from Polletta
et al. (2007). We plot those templates with efforts to remove the
star-formation contamination as solid lines and marked them with

The possible different levels of contamination from the IR light emitted by the host galaxies could underlie the
broad distribution of the far-IR SEDs among different tem- plates. Several groups have attempted to remove this con- tamination from the AGN template::
